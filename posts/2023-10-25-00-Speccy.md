# An Exciting Journey Down Memory Lane

Around three decades ago, during my high school days, a few friends and I delved into the world of "cracking" ZX Spectrum games. Any self-respecting crackers at that time added small loaders that endowed cracked games with infinite lives or ammo. These loaders, commonly referred to as [Crack Intros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_intro) or "cracktros," became the trademark of crackers. Crack-intro programming eventually became an art form the better crackers had the most complex cracktros (even more complicated than a game itself)  

Writing those cracktros developed into an expression of our growing expertise. The deeper we immersed ourselves in the ZX Spectrum's programming secrets, the more elaborate our cracktros became. But unfortunately, none of our cracktros have survived the years.  

Fast forward to 2019, and my passion for the ZX Spectrum remained unchanged. As an ode to this iconic machine, I made a [ShaderToy Tribute to Speccy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ltKyRK), mirroring the essence and style of our earlier cracktros.  

Recently, I bought a real authentic ZX Spectrum on eBay (I've never had a real one, only Soviet ZX clones). The temptation of programming on this 40-year-old relic was irresistible. Without further ado, I embarked on a journey to translate my ShaderToy tribute into a genuine Spectrum demo.

And now, I'm thrilled to present my work running authentically on the real Speccy:
