# Hello World

Inspired by [Angelo's journey](https://c0de517e.com/000_reinventing_the_wheel.htm) and in search of a more streamlined platform to write down my thoughts, I've transitioned away from Jekyll.
While Jekyll seemed nice, I never quite found the time to tinker with it.  

Since I'm an engineer, I quickly put together a simple markdown HTML renderer.
This finally allows me to effortlessly render arbitrary `.MD` files in the form of blog posts.  

Although I'm uncertain about how frequently I'll write, the process now is similar to writing a README.md for a GitHub repository or a Commit message,
which gives me hope to write more than I did before.
